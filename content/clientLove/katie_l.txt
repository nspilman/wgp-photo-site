"Dan is the perfect combination of professional and involved. His experience led to many beautiful shots that were dreamt up by his passion for photography, rather than beautifying a point and shoot. While his skill and quality are that of a professional, he was personally invested on a much more individual level, even going out and purchasing additional materials (at no small cost) in order to fulfill a more artistic vision. Dan is a fantastic photographer and was the perfect choice for my fianc√© and I. While the pictures that we requested were fantastic, it was the pictures where we let him run with it that produced the most frame-able moments. He CANNOT be beaten for the price, and we would use him again in a heartbeat." Katie L.
