We couldn't be more pleased with our engagement and wedding shots!  There're some people out there that just have 'the eye' for capturing perfect moments and Dan is one of those people.  Mix all that in with the fact that he's just a genuinely awesome guy to be around and you've got something really special.  The cherry on top was that we got our photos back insanely fast!  It's like we were able to relive our special day with it still fresh in our minds.  Thank you, Wine Guy Photography, for the amazing shots and making everything so seamlessly easy on us!
