"First of all, Dan was very quick to get back to me, and set up the shoot. The senior pictures he did for my son were crisp and clear, with plenty of options to choose from, black and white and color. He allowed 3 different changes of clothes, which was great. He is very creative on different locations and variety of poses. I would highly recommend him." Julie D.
