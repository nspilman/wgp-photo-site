"Great session - Amazing Images. Dan took senior photos of my daughter and several students that I work with. He provided clear instructions, photo tips and a contract prior to the sitting. He scouted out the locations I requested prior to the photo session and was well prepared. He was flexible and willing to take suggestions of photo poses I suggested. He shared amazing images within 24 hours of the session. Highly satisfied customer!!" Amy W.
