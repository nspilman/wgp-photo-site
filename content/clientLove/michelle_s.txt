"The outdoor photos Dan took of our son for his High School Senior picture are INCREDIBLE! His artistry, experience and passion for what he does is evident in EVERY photo: the variety of poses, the sense of color combinations, the eye for background and foreground choices, the clarity of the images, the use of both color and black & white to create the images. He captured the essence of our son in ways familiar and unique, as well as evocative of the person our son is becoming. Dan's flexibility regarding scheduling and locations for the photo session was much appreciated, as were his suggestions for making the photo session a great experience the whole way around. We would recommend Dan in a heartbeat!!!" Michele S.
