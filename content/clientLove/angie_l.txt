"We are so pleased with Dan's photos of our wedding! He captured priceless action shots, worked closely with us to execute our ideas, and scoped out the scenery on sites to carefully choose photo locations. Dan paid close attention to lighting and performed beautiful editing to enhance coloring and create timeless effects in our photos... We'll be returning to Wine Guy Photography for all of our future life events requiring photography. We trust Dan to take the best photos for us and our family to cherish forever! We also love his friendly, down-to-earth personality and sincere willingness to go out of his way to deliver amazing photo outcomes!" Angie L.
