"Talented artist with the camera. Captured my husband and me in ways any previous pictures had not accomplished. Our love shown directly from his lens. Dan captures sports action shots that make you feel as if you are out on the court or field, experiencing the excitement yourselves. And the children's photos make a person want to reach out and hug each child. He captures their very inner essence and joy." Lynn K.
