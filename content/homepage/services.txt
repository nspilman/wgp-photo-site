###### WEDDINGS
Your wedding day is one of the most important days of your life. I believe that you should choose a photographer that you feel a deep connection with, and whose style of images truly resonates with you.

###### SENIOR PHOTOS
I absolutely love shooting Seniors! My sessions are less about taking a great portrait for the yearbook (although we’ll definitely do that!) and more about getting a ton of great images to commemorate this awesome rite of passage and moment in time.

###### FAMILY AND PETS
Everybody finally together for the holidays? Want to capture the kids at this adorable age? New puppy? Whatever your portrait needs, I can make it happen for you.

###### SPECIAL EVENTS
Whether it be a family reunion, bat mitzvah, quinceañera, anniversary, or birthday party. I’ll be there to commemorate your special event.
